Made the cuts for the bottom rails. Made trickier than it should have been just because my table saw, a cheap Ryobi, won&#8217;t make clean cuts. So I actually made them with my Porter-Cable router, routing off about a half inch at a pass.

Next, I can finally do some pre-assembly to see how things fit together. And then I&#8217;ll start looking to do the ornamental cuts.
