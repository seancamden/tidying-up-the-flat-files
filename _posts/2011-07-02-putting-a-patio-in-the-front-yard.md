The lawn is long gone. I tried real hard, honest I did. But then the [bermuda grass](http://www.ppws.vt.edu/scott/weed_id/cynda.htm) came, and that was that. But lawn&#8217;s are kind of ridiculous anyway; they suck up so much water. So, we&#8217;ve decided to put in a patio.<figure id="attachment_402" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

We just endured our first quote from a paver salesman, and it was pretty awful. Pushy, aggressively ingratiating, and he could not stop talking about how great his company is and how he never loses a sale. And the price: hoo boy. We weren&#8217;t expecting this to be cheap, but wow those were some big numbers. I wish he could have just emailed them to us; enduring a second visit was a chore. As his mood changed from bubbly to maudlin (&#8220;I really thought I was going to make a sale today.&#8221; he said sadly), all I could think about was getting him out of our house.

We may go with stamped concrete, too. Although we haven&#8217;t gotten any quotes for that yet, we expect it to be cheaper.
