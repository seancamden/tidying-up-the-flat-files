				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TextBlob is a fun Python library that allows one to parse blocks of text in neat ways.</p>
<p>To use it, all you need is a computer with <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> on it. I&#8217;m using <a href="http://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> with Python 2.7.3. Installation of TextBlob is covered pretty well on <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Steve Loria&#8217;s TextBlob page</a>.</p>
<p>To begin I open my Python interpreter and import TextBlob.<br />
<code>>>> from textblob import TextBlob</code></p>
<p>Then I load my text. I&#8217;m using a chunk of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28054">The Brothers Karamazov</a>.<br />
<code>>>> with open(r"/home/sean/Documents/text-blobs/the-brothers-karamazov/brothers-044") as infile:<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;data = infile.read()<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;myblob = TextBlob(data)<br />
...<br />
</code></p>
<p>Now I have a TextBlob object named &#8220;myblob&#8221; and I can do fun stuff with it. For instance, I can loop through it and pull out all the adjectives.<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if key == "JJ":<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
JJ back<br />
JJ back-way<br />
JJ black<br />
JJ certain<br />
JJ civil<br />
JJ clear<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>By setting up my <code>for</code> loop with the <code>sorted()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods, the output is alphabetized and will contain no duplicates.</p>
<p>But suppose I only want to see the adjectives that are five characters long. Then I use Python&#8217;s <code>len()</code> method. Like so:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if key == "JJ" and len(value) == 5:<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
JJ black<br />
JJ civil<br />
JJ clear<br />
JJ equal<br />
JJ first<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>I can sort for verbs, too; in fact, any part of speech listed in the <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/mbsp-tags">Penn Treebank II tag set</a> will work.</p>
<p>The Penn Treebank code for gerunds is VBG. But sometimes I want all the words that end in &#8220;ing&#8221; even if it&#8217;s not a gerund. In that case, I use Python&#8217;s string methods instead. Like so:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if value[-3:] == "ing":<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
VBG according<br />
NN anything<br />
VBG behaving<br />
VBG bringing<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>Using Python&#8217;s handy string methods I can easily test for a word that begins with a particular letter, too. Here I&#8217;ll throw in the <code>lower()</code> method to match regardless of case:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if value[0].lower() == "a":<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
DT A<br />
IN Among<br />
NNP April<br />
IN At<br />
DT a<br />
IN about<br />
VBG according<br />
VBN accustomed<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>But what if I want to match all the words that start with vowels? Well, I think I&#8217;m going to need a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">regular expression</a> to do that. (I love regular expressions.)</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll import Python&#8217;s regex library and then create my regular expression.<br />
<code>>>> import re<br />
>>> reg = re.compile('^[aeiou]\w*', re.IGNORECASE)<br />
</code></p>
<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m looking for any word that begins &#8220;<code>^</code>&#8221; with a vowel &#8220;<code>[aeiou]</code>&#8221; and is followed by zero or more &#8220;<code>*</code>&#8221; alphanumeric characters &#8220;<code>\w</code>&#8221; and I want to ignore case. Then I just use another <code>for</code> loop, only this time with my new regex. Like so:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if reg.match(value):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
DT A<br />
IN Among<br />
NNP April<br />
IN At<br />
DT Every<br />
IN If<br />
IN In<br />
PRP It<br />
IN Of<br />
DT a<br />
IN about<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>All the base form verbs that start with a vowel:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if key == "VB" and reg.match(value):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
VB act<br />
VB entertain<br />
VB estrange<br />
VB in<br />
VB into<br />
</code></p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, my kids&#8217; doctor asked me how often we eat fast food and I said, &#8216;never.&#8217; Then later I wondered if Panda Express counted. I suppose it could, depending on what you order, so maybe I&#8217;ll mention it next time we&#8217;re at the doctor&#8217;s office. But we will continue to eat there from time to time, because it&#8217;s tasty and it seems healthy, for the most part.</p>
<p>I think we should all stop eating shrimp. The <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029672_Shrimp_environment.html">damage we&#8217;ve done to our oceans in the name of a few prawn cocktails</a> is terrible, and <a href="http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/40963">shrimp farming is pretty bad</a>, too. And while <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?fid=44">good options for shrimp</a> exist, I seriously doubt anyone&#8217;s going to go to the trouble to find out where their shrimp louie came from.</p>
<p>That said, Panda Express works well for us because my wife and I have all but eliminated noodles, rice, bread, and potatoes from our diet. The kids still eat bread and all; it&#8217;s mainly our diets in which it&#8217;s been deprecated. And we can order a plate full of vegetables there, instead of rice or noodles, to go with our entr&eacute;es.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as we entered Panda Express we were greeted by about twenty employees, all of whom enthusiastically welcomed us in a fashion I haven&#8217;t experienced since visiting Tokyo, where the workers of every store or eatery will loudly welcome you as soon as you enter. Only this time we were in a Chinese restaurant in our hometown of Novato.</p>
<p>I was excited to have an opportunity to use the few words in Mandarin I know, 喜欢中国菜 (I like Chinese food). To which the man I was speaking to replied, &#8220;Me too!&#8221; Amusingly, that man was Andrew Cherng, the man who founded Panda Express. Affable and approachable, he was happy to take a photo with me. That&#8217;s him in the photo on the wall behind us, too, albeit a little younger.</p>

<p>Pushed a bunch of changes to the live site this morning (Friday) that weren&#8217;t supposed to go until Monday. Woops! Fortunately, I use Git and Git rocks!</p>
<p>First, to undo the changes I typed &lsquo;<code>git revert</code>&rsquo; and the SHA of the commit in question. (I think I could have just done &lsquo;<code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code>&rsquo; if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that I had already done another commit by the time I was informed of my mistake.) Now my working directory is back to the way it was before that commit (but preserving the one that came after).</p>
<p>Then I moved those files onto the live server, undoing my error. Whew! Pretty painless.</p>
<p>Now my working directory or branch is ahead of &lsquo;origin/master&rsquo; by 1 commit, and I want to bring back those changes so that I can push them Monday like I&#8217;m supposed to. I type &lsquo;<code>git reset --hard origin/master</code>&rsquo; and I&#8217;m back, like magic.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://github.com/">Git developers</a>.</p>

<p>Sean,</p>
<p>I would make an appointment. Just as an aside, the email system should be used only if you can wait 24-48 hours for a response. It is not for more urgent needs.</p>
<p>Hope that helps</p>
<p>Doctor #2. </p></blockquote>
<p>Which is interesting, since I can&#8217;t actually find anywhere on the site that says <em>&#8220;Only use this if you can wait one or two days for a response.&#8221;</em> It says, <em>&#8220;Send nonurgent health questions to your doctor&#8217;s office.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m unsatisfied with this. I want the interface to work. If the doctor is in, it should not say that he is out. And in the event that it reports things incorrectly, I would like the doctors to accept responsibility for their organization&#8217;s system and apologize for my inconvenience. And if I can&#8217;t expect what in my opinion is a modicum of service, then why am I paying so dearly for it? Shouldn&#8217;t this level of sloppy service be easily achieved by some socialist healthcare system?</p>

<p>I came down with this Sunday of last week and it has not improved by any notable amount. Any new advice?</p>
<p>P.S. I really don&#8217;t blame you for being confused. The patient-facing interface of [this web based messaging system] is a train-wreck of unintuitive design, so I expect the doctor-facing side must be at least as bad. You still appear to be &#8220;out of office.&#8221; Of course, maybe you really are out of office and you simply neglected to mention that in your last email.</p></blockquote>
