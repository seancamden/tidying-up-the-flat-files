<p><a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/">The Humble Bundle returns</a> with games from <a href="http://frozenbyte.com/">Frozenbyte, an independent game development company</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t actually have time to play games much these days, but I love supporting <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm">DRM</a>-free software. For my $50 (I picked the amount!) I got not only the games themselves, which I can download from their servers as many times as I need for whichever of three operating systems I need, but also the games’ soundtracks are included as folders of MP3s. And the tracks, all written by <a href="http://www.aripulkkinen.com/">Ari Pulkkinen</a>, are quite good.</p>
