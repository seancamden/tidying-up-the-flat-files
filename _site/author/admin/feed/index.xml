				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TextBlob is a fun Python library that allows one to parse blocks of text in neat ways.</p>
<p>To use it, all you need is a computer with <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> on it. I&#8217;m using <a href="http://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> with Python 2.7.3. Installation of TextBlob is covered pretty well on <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Steve Loria&#8217;s TextBlob page</a>.</p>
<p>To begin I open my Python interpreter and import TextBlob.<br />
<code>>>> from textblob import TextBlob</code></p>
<p>Then I load my text. I&#8217;m using a chunk of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28054">The Brothers Karamazov</a>.<br />
<code>>>> with open(r"/home/sean/Documents/text-blobs/the-brothers-karamazov/brothers-044") as infile:<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;data = infile.read()<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;myblob = TextBlob(data)<br />
...<br />
</code></p>
<p>Now I have a TextBlob object named &#8220;myblob&#8221; and I can do fun stuff with it. For instance, I can loop through it and pull out all the adjectives.<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if key == "JJ":<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
JJ back<br />
JJ back-way<br />
JJ black<br />
JJ certain<br />
JJ civil<br />
JJ clear<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>By setting up my <code>for</code> loop with the <code>sorted()</code> and <code>set()</code> methods, the output is alphabetized and will contain no duplicates.</p>
<p>But suppose I only want to see the adjectives that are five characters long. Then I use Python&#8217;s <code>len()</code> method. Like so:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if key == "JJ" and len(value) == 5:<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
JJ black<br />
JJ civil<br />
JJ clear<br />
JJ equal<br />
JJ first<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>I can sort for verbs, too; in fact, any part of speech listed in the <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/mbsp-tags">Penn Treebank II tag set</a> will work.</p>
<p>The Penn Treebank code for gerunds is VBG. But sometimes I want all the words that end in &#8220;ing&#8221; even if it&#8217;s not a gerund. In that case, I use Python&#8217;s string methods instead. Like so:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if value[-3:] == "ing":<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
VBG according<br />
NN anything<br />
VBG behaving<br />
VBG bringing<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>Using Python&#8217;s handy string methods I can easily test for a word that begins with a particular letter, too. Here I&#8217;ll throw in the <code>lower()</code> method to match regardless of case:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if value[0].lower() == "a":<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
DT A<br />
IN Among<br />
NNP April<br />
IN At<br />
DT a<br />
IN about<br />
VBG according<br />
VBN accustomed<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>But what if I want to match all the words that start with vowels? Well, I think I&#8217;m going to need a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">regular expression</a> to do that. (I love regular expressions.)</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll import Python&#8217;s regex library and then create my regular expression.<br />
<code>>>> import re<br />
>>> reg = re.compile('^[aeiou]\w*', re.IGNORECASE)<br />
</code></p>
<p>As you can see, I&#8217;m looking for any word that begins &#8220;<code>^</code>&#8221; with a vowel &#8220;<code>[aeiou]</code>&#8221; and is followed by zero or more &#8220;<code>*</code>&#8221; alphanumeric characters &#8220;<code>\w</code>&#8221; and I want to ignore case. Then I just use another <code>for</code> loop, only this time with my new regex. Like so:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if reg.match(value):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
DT A<br />
IN Among<br />
NNP April<br />
IN At<br />
DT Every<br />
IN If<br />
IN In<br />
PRP It<br />
IN Of<br />
DT a<br />
IN about<br />
--and so on...<br />
</code></p>
<p>All the base form verbs that start with a vowel:<br />
<code>>>> for value,key in sorted(set(myblob.tags)):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;if key == "VB" and reg.match(value):<br />
... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print key,value<br />
...<br />
VB act<br />
VB entertain<br />
VB estrange<br />
VB in<br />
VB into<br />
</code></p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, my kids&#8217; doctor asked me how often we eat fast food and I said, &#8216;never.&#8217; Then later I wondered if Panda Express counted. I suppose it could, depending on what you order, so maybe I&#8217;ll mention it next time we&#8217;re at the doctor&#8217;s office. But we will continue to eat there from time to time, because it&#8217;s tasty and it seems healthy, for the most part.</p>
<p>I think we should all stop eating shrimp. The <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029672_Shrimp_environment.html">damage we&#8217;ve done to our oceans in the name of a few prawn cocktails</a> is terrible, and <a href="http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/40963">shrimp farming is pretty bad</a>, too. And while <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?fid=44">good options for shrimp</a> exist, I seriously doubt anyone&#8217;s going to go to the trouble to find out where their shrimp louie came from.</p>
<p>That said, Panda Express works well for us because my wife and I have all but eliminated noodles, rice, bread, and potatoes from our diet. The kids still eat bread and all; it&#8217;s mainly our diets in which it&#8217;s been deprecated. And we can order a plate full of vegetables there, instead of rice or noodles, to go with our entr&eacute;es.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as we entered Panda Express we were greeted by about twenty employees, all of whom enthusiastically welcomed us in a fashion I haven&#8217;t experienced since visiting Tokyo, where the workers of every store or eatery will loudly welcome you as soon as you enter. Only this time we were in a Chinese restaurant in our hometown of Novato.</p>
<p>I was excited to have an opportunity to use the few words in Mandarin I know, 喜欢中国菜 (I like Chinese food). To which the man I was speaking to replied, &#8220;Me too!&#8221; Amusingly, that man was Andrew Cherng, the man who founded Panda Express. Affable and approachable, he was happy to take a photo with me. That&#8217;s him in the photo on the wall behind us, too, albeit a little younger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Photoshop allows you to place a guide anywhere, which can be frustrating if you do Web work and you want to cut an image by hand.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-guide-not-on-pixel.png" alt="photoshop-guide-not-on-pixel" width="467" height="714" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-504" /></p>
<p>Because your selections will miss the guides&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-selection-missed.png" alt="photoshop-selection-missed" width="467" height="714" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-516" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-selection-missed.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-selection-missed-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>&#8230;and the things you create will have fuzzy edges.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-fuzzy-rectangle.png" alt="photoshop-fuzzy-rectangle" width="467" height="714" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-517" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-fuzzy-rectangle.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-fuzzy-rectangle-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>But Photoshop will only select things by the pixel. So, the key to getting your guides right on the border between two pixels is to select first&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-selection1.png" alt="photoshop-selection" width="467" height="714" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-518" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-selection1.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-selection1-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>&#8230;then create your guides, snapping them to the edges of the selection.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-guides-snapped-to-selection.png" alt="photoshop-guides-snapped-to-selection" width="467" height="714" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-520" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-guides-snapped-to-selection.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-guides-snapped-to-selection-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>Of course, you&#8217;ll need to make sure your Snap To is set.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-snap-to-set.png" alt="photoshop-snap-to-set" width="467" height="714" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-511" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-snap-to-set.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-snap-to-set-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>Do it this way, and the things you create will have nice, clean edges.</p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-clean-box.png" alt="photoshop-clean-box" width="467" height="714" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-521" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-clean-box.png 467w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photoshop-clean-box-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>

I followed <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Samba">Samba for Arch Linux</a> and the <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/support/guides/applications/samba">Arch Linux Arm Guide to Samba</a> to get Samba working on my <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<p>This version of Arch Arm is using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd">systemd</a> to manage services, so there is no more <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> file to edit and no <code>rc.d</code> command available to start anything (as the Arch Linux Arm Guide instructs). One simply types <code>systemctl start smbd.service</code> to make it go (after configuring <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>, of course).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just added a bunch of movies to my Netflix Streaming Queue. A few of them I&#8217;ve seen already but will enjoy watching again. </p>
<p>Much has been said about <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/02/02/netflixs-lousy-selection-of-movies/">Netflix&#8217;s lousy selection of movies</a>, and I suppose it&#8217;s true. However, I think only the extremely myopic could fail to notice one thing: Netflix is the only big player in the streaming movie business that isn&#8217;t gouging its customers.</p>
<p>I pay $8 a month for access to thousands of movies. Sure, they&#8217;re not all A-Listers, but that eight bucks I pay grants me 24-hour access to watch all or part of each of them whenever I want without restriction. That&#8217;s a good deal.</p>
<p>For comparison, I paid Amazon Video on Demand over $35 just in the last two months to watch just a handfull of movies and have had to watch the ones I &#8220;paid for&#8221; within 48 hours. That&#8217;s a bad deal, and here&#8217;s why: </p>
<p>Streaming a movie over a wire costs a lot less than producing and shipping a DVD or a Bluray. Managing the bits over a wire is probably less than one tenth as expensive, but it could be much lower. Even if you want to quibble with my math, which is obviously not the result of an exhaustive statistical analysis, you have to see that bits over a wire changes the scenario in profound ways. </p>
<p>The streaming method allows for no possible way for damage to be done to the movie. That means a great deal of the risk inherent in managing physical products simply evaporates.</p>
<p>One of my favorite industry terms is, &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkage_%28accounting%29">shrinkage</a>.&#8221; It basically means theft, but it also covers fraud and error. And it&#8217;s a huge problem in retail. According to a study <a href="http://www.ey.com/">Ernst &#038; Young</a> conducted, <a href="http://www.jrrobertssecurity.com/security-news/security-crime-news0024.htm">U.S. Retailers lost approximately $31 Billion to shrinkage</a> in 2002. The term is evocative, I think. One can easily see the usefulness of the notion of physical inventory shrinking without being properly paid for. With digital goods, there is no shrinkage. Even if &#8220;<a href="http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2011/09/is-file-sharing-theft.html">theft</a>&#8221; occurs, the inventory never shrinks.</p>
<p>The cost of housing all those physical copies, the rent on the building, the cost of driving them around, the long chain of production facilities needed to produce and package the disk: all gone.</p>
<p>No longer does this business require that the popularity of certain movies be forecast; nor does this business ever have to account for the losses involved in purchasing too many or too few copies to match the poorly predicted demand.</p>
<p>Because digital storage and delivery shifts the distribution related limits into the elastic realm of virtual servers, whoever has the bandwidth to connect can watch the movie. Limits to the number of people who can be served have effectively vanished.</p>
<p>The concept of a timed rental arose out of a proprietor&#8217;s need to get the movie back so as to rent it again. If any one client kept the physical copy too long it would directly jeopardize the transaction&#8217;s profitability; hence the &#8220;late fee.&#8221; This simply does not apply to a digital copy of a movie. It makes no difference at all how long the purchaser takes to consume a digital product. The proprietor can distribute without limits. Amazon and others expect you will not realize this. They assume you will obediently pay for a limitation imposed by the failings of a physical good on a completely unaffected digital one. And so far, it seems they are right.</p>
<p>They would be wrong and this would be obvious to you, probably, if it weren&#8217;t for the memory of the old way of doing things still fresh in your mind. It is so hard to move beyond our habits. But if you could, you would see that such a fee makes about as much sense as a &#8220;<a href="http://www.thedailybizarre.com/?p=173">convenience fee</a>&#8221; on show tickets that no longer burden the distributor with the cost of printing or shipping. Oh yeah, we&#8217;re getting screwed all over the place.</p>
<p>So maybe one or more of the movies I list below will help you set aside your burning desire to consume the latest that Hollywood has to offer, while patronizing one of the few big companies not aggressively trying to screw you sideways.</p>

<p>Pushed a bunch of changes to the live site this morning (Friday) that weren&#8217;t supposed to go until Monday. Woops! Fortunately, I use Git and Git rocks!</p>
<p>First, to undo the changes I typed &lsquo;<code>git revert</code>&rsquo; and the SHA of the commit in question. (I think I could have just done &lsquo;<code>git reset --soft HEAD^</code>&rsquo; if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that I had already done another commit by the time I was informed of my mistake.) Now my working directory is back to the way it was before that commit (but preserving the one that came after).</p>
<p>Then I moved those files onto the live server, undoing my error. Whew! Pretty painless.</p>
<p>Now my working directory or branch is ahead of &lsquo;origin/master&rsquo; by 1 commit, and I want to bring back those changes so that I can push them Monday like I&#8217;m supposed to. I type &lsquo;<code>git reset --hard origin/master</code>&rsquo; and I&#8217;m back, like magic.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://github.com/">Git developers</a>.</p>

<p>China is the place I always imagined I would end up if I simply started digging straight down and didn&#8217;t stop. I developed this conviction with the help of those stalwart researchers at Looney Tunes University (I seem to recall professors Fudd and Bunny demonstrating quite clearly how this was the case). But it turns out the actual spot is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean about a thousand miles south east of Madagascar.</p>

The lawn is long gone. I tried real hard, honest I did. But then the <a href="http://www.ppws.vt.edu/scott/weed_id/cynda.htm">bermuda grass</a> came, and that was that. But lawn&#8217;s are kind of ridiculous anyway; they suck up so much water. So, we&#8217;ve decided to put in a patio.</p>
<div id="attachment_402" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/stuff/front-yard-2015-bricks-2c.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-402" title="front-yard-2015-bricks-2d" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg" alt="The patio we hope to have for our front yard." width="624" height="468" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg 624w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We hope it will look something like this.</p></div>
<p>We just endured our first quote from a paver salesman, and it was pretty awful. Pushy, aggressively ingratiating, and he could not stop talking about how great his company is and how he never loses a sale. And the price: hoo boy. We weren&#8217;t expecting this to be cheap, but wow those were some big numbers. I wish he could have just emailed them to us; enduring a second visit was a chore. As his mood changed from bubbly to maudlin (&#8220;I really thought I was going to make a sale today.&#8221; he said sadly), all I could think about was getting him out of our house.</p>
<p>We may go with stamped concrete, too. Although we haven&#8217;t gotten any quotes for that yet, we expect it to be cheaper.</p>
