<p>Pushed a bunch of changes to the live site this morning (Friday) that weren’t supposed to go until Monday. Woops! Fortunately, I use Git and Git rocks!</p>

<p>First, to undo the changes I typed ‘<code class="highlighter-rouge">git revert</code>’ and the SHA of the commit in question. (I think I could have just done ‘<code class="highlighter-rouge">git reset --soft HEAD^</code>’ if it weren’t for the fact that I had already done another commit by the time I was informed of my mistake.) Now my working directory is back to the way it was before that commit (but preserving the one that came after).</p>

<p>Then I moved those files onto the live server, undoing my error. Whew! Pretty painless.</p>

<p>Now my working directory or branch is ahead of ‘origin/master’ by 1 commit, and I want to bring back those changes so that I can push them Monday like I’m supposed to. I type ‘<code class="highlighter-rouge">git reset --hard origin/master</code>’ and I’m back, like magic.</p>

<p>Thank you, <a href="https://github.com/">Git developers</a>.</p>
