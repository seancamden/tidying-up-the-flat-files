<p>Made the cuts for the bottom rails. Made trickier than it should have been just because my table saw, a cheap Ryobi, won’t make clean cuts. So I actually made them with my Porter-Cable router, routing off about a half inch at a pass.</p>

<p>Next, I can finally do some pre-assembly to see how things fit together. And then I’ll start looking to do the ornamental cuts.</p>
