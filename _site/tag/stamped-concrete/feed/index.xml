The lawn is long gone. I tried real hard, honest I did. But then the <a href="http://www.ppws.vt.edu/scott/weed_id/cynda.htm">bermuda grass</a> came, and that was that. But lawn&#8217;s are kind of ridiculous anyway; they suck up so much water. So, we&#8217;ve decided to put in a patio.</p>
<div id="attachment_402" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/stuff/front-yard-2015-bricks-2c.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-402" title="front-yard-2015-bricks-2d" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg" alt="The patio we hope to have for our front yard." width="624" height="468" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg 624w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We hope it will look something like this.</p></div>
<p>We just endured our first quote from a paver salesman, and it was pretty awful. Pushy, aggressively ingratiating, and he could not stop talking about how great his company is and how he never loses a sale. And the price: hoo boy. We weren&#8217;t expecting this to be cheap, but wow those were some big numbers. I wish he could have just emailed them to us; enduring a second visit was a chore. As his mood changed from bubbly to maudlin (&#8220;I really thought I was going to make a sale today.&#8221; he said sadly), all I could think about was getting him out of our house.</p>
<p>We may go with stamped concrete, too. Although we haven&#8217;t gotten any quotes for that yet, we expect it to be cheaper.</p>
