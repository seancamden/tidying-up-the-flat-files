<p>Sean,</p>
<p>I would make an appointment. Just as an aside, the email system should be used only if you can wait 24-48 hours for a response. It is not for more urgent needs.</p>
<p>Hope that helps</p>
<p>Doctor #2. </p></blockquote>
<p>Which is interesting, since I can&#8217;t actually find anywhere on the site that says <em>&#8220;Only use this if you can wait one or two days for a response.&#8221;</em> It says, <em>&#8220;Send nonurgent health questions to your doctor&#8217;s office.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m unsatisfied with this. I want the interface to work. If the doctor is in, it should not say that he is out. And in the event that it reports things incorrectly, I would like the doctors to accept responsibility for their organization&#8217;s system and apologize for my inconvenience. And if I can&#8217;t expect what in my opinion is a modicum of service, then why am I paying so dearly for it? Shouldn&#8217;t this level of sloppy service be easily achieved by some socialist healthcare system?</p>

<p>P.S. I really don&#8217;t blame you for being confused. The patient-facing interface of [this web based messaging system] is a train-wreck of unintuitive design, so I expect the doctor-facing side must be at least as bad. You still appear to be &#8220;out of office.&#8221; Of course, maybe you really are out of office and you simply neglected to mention that in your last email.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi Sean</p>
<p>Doctor #2 and I are a bit confused as to who you identify as your Doc. Either way is fine but we request you only email one or the other to avoid confusion</p>
<p>Almost all of these illness are viral. Most take 5 -7 days for improvement and resolve on their own. Viruses do not respond to antibiotic. A true bacteria sinus infection is a secondary infection and actually a fairly unusual complication of a viral upper respiratory illness. These come on after 7 &#8211; 10 days. They are usually characterized by a cold which doesn&#8217;t improve after 7 -10 days or one that improves and then becomes worse.</p>
<p>Green or colored mucous is frequently seen in a viral illness, so we can&#8217;t differentiate viral from bacterial based on this.</p>
<p>I would suggest over the counter cold remedies and salt water nasal rinses. These are comfort measures and don&#8217;t speed up the recovery process, but can relieve some of the symptoms. Please inform patient to follow-up if any new symptoms, things worsen or fail to improve in the next 4 -5 days.</p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p>Dr. #1</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi, I came down with a cold last Sunday night and now my head is clogging up and my left ear starting to throb a bit. I&#8217;ve been on Nyquil for the last four nights and so have been sleeping well. But I&#8217;ve also been working 12+ hour days for the last two or three weeks. Any advice? (Tomorrow is my last day on my current gig.) Thanks!</p>
<p>Just in case you don&#8217;t remember me: I&#8217;m Doctor #1&#8217;s patient who had pneumonia a few months ago.</p></blockquote>
