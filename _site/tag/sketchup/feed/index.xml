The lawn is long gone. I tried real hard, honest I did. But then the <a href="http://www.ppws.vt.edu/scott/weed_id/cynda.htm">bermuda grass</a> came, and that was that. But lawn&#8217;s are kind of ridiculous anyway; they suck up so much water. So, we&#8217;ve decided to put in a patio.</p>
<div id="attachment_402" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/stuff/front-yard-2015-bricks-2c.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-402" title="front-yard-2015-bricks-2d" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg" alt="The patio we hope to have for our front yard." width="624" height="468" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg 624w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We hope it will look something like this.</p></div>
<p>We just endured our first quote from a paver salesman, and it was pretty awful. Pushy, aggressively ingratiating, and he could not stop talking about how great his company is and how he never loses a sale. And the price: hoo boy. We weren&#8217;t expecting this to be cheap, but wow those were some big numbers. I wish he could have just emailed them to us; enduring a second visit was a chore. As his mood changed from bubbly to maudlin (&#8220;I really thought I was going to make a sale today.&#8221; he said sadly), all I could think about was getting him out of our house.</p>
<p>We may go with stamped concrete, too. Although we haven&#8217;t gotten any quotes for that yet, we expect it to be cheaper.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Made the cuts for the bottom rails. Made trickier than it should have been just because my table saw, a cheap Ryobi, won&#8217;t make clean cuts. So I actually made them with my Porter-Cable router, routing off about a half inch at a pass.<br />

Next, I can finally do some pre-assembly to see how things fit together. And then I&#8217;ll start looking to do the ornamental cuts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://seancamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet3-300x281.jpg" alt="" title="Dress-up closet initial design" width="300" height="281" class="size-medium wp-image-157" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet3-300x281.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet3.jpg 732w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
First step was designing it in Sketchup. <a href="http://seancamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet.zip">Download the skp file</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://seancamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet4-300x281.jpg" alt="" title="Dress-up closet exploded view" width="300" height="281" class="size-medium wp-image-158" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet4-300x281.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet4.jpg 732w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
Then I laid out the pieces to see how to cut them out of an 8&#8217;x4&#8242; sheet of 1/2&#8243; plywood.</p>
<p><img src="http://seancamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/2010-05-25-12.20.35-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Pieces of wood" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-159" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/2010-05-25-12.20.35-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/2010-05-25-12.20.35-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><br />
And cut &#8217;em out.</p>
<p>Next it will be time to do some routing. I will use the circle cutting jig I just made to rout the curved tops of the closet sides.</p>
<p><img src="http://seancamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/2010-05-21-16.31.57-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Circle cutting router jig" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-162" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/2010-05-21-16.31.57-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2010/05/2010-05-21-16.31.57-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>After that I&#8217;ll shape most of the exposed edges with the router before I begin assembly. </p>
