<p>I sent this using the hospital-supplied messaging system to an alternate doctor because, according to the system, my primary doctor was not in the office at the time.</p>

  <p>Hi, I came down with a cold last Sunday night and now my head is clogging up and my left ear starting to throb a bit. I’ve been on Nyquil for the last four nights and so have been sleeping well. But I’ve also been working 12+ hour days for the last two or three weeks. Any advice? (Tomorrow is my last day on my current gig.) Thanks!</p>

  <p>Just in case you don’t remember me: I’m Doctor #1’s patient who had pneumonia a few months ago.</p>
