		<description><![CDATA[Just took my BDP-S360 out of the box...setup the initial TV settings.  Then did the firmware update...BRICKED!!  Got the triangle of death and the SYS ERR displayed...I am so pissed!  Had &quot;Taken&quot; ready to watch too.  Sony (Ernie-a guy that could barly speak english) told me the same...7 - 10 days from the time I get the unit to Texas for &quot;Repairs&quot;.  F them!  It&#039;s going back to the vendor and I think I&#039;ll get a Samsung instead.]]></description>

Worked out of box.

Got the player configured wirelessly.

Downloaded update, while installing it crashed.

Triangle with exclamation point on screen, Sys Err on Player.

Sony told me it would take 7 days - from what you guys say, I better go ahead and get another.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear about all the hassle however I purchased my Sony bdp-s360 from Walmart for $118 in early December. I&#039;m pretty sure the firmware installed was .006. I went online to the Sony site made a disc and updated to .007 and it has worked fine since. Honestly, unless I had bought it online if I encountered an issue I would have just returned it for a new one. To hell with sending it back. Just keep trying until you get a good one. It seems rather obvious that there was a bad batch of players. They could be mixed up all over the country as well so who knows where you would find a batch that&#039;s not screwed. I&#039;ve given up on Brand loyalty because it seems like every company creates crap nowadays anyway. I hope some of you with issues returned yours and got a good one because it&#039;s a pretty good player if it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just had this error on my new BDP-S760.
Only had it a day!
When I connected it up I setup wireless internet access and checked for updates - it said I was already up to date.
Watched half of Iron Man to test it out and downloaded some BD Live content OK.
A few hours later I put District 9 in and clicked BD Live content and I was told I didn&#039;t have internet access so went back into settings to see why.
It couldn&#039;t find my access point or any others and there are loads visible in my house. The configuration settings I had entered were all there correct but it couldn&#039;t see the wireless network at all.
I switched it off and tried again twice - still no access points available.
I decided to switch it off at the wall but when it came back on I just got &quot;Wait&quot; then &quot;Sys Err&quot;.
It&#039;s now a brick and I didn&#039;t even do a firmware update!
Can&#039;t eject the disk by powering on with eject held down like it says on the Sony support site so I can&#039;t even try a disk firmware update to see if that&#039;s the problem.
I&#039;ll have to take it back to the Sony shop and get a replacement but I&#039;ll probably lose my copy of District 9 without even watching it!
What a nightmare.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I followed Sony&#039;s step by step instructions to install a firmware update and now my Blu-ray player
is a brick. When i inserted the CD it was recognized
by the brick , it told me what firmware version i
currently had and that i had put in a firmware upgrade disc with xxx.007 to select ok and it would
update it for me. It displays YUP 0/9 then YUP 1/9
and then YUP 2/9 and that is as far as the process
got when the player ejected the update disc and displayed YUP NG. As per Sony&#039;s instructions i pressed the power button until the player turned off
and then powered it back on and was instructed by the site to reinsert the disc and after doing so the
player simply keep ejecting it. When i turned it back on the YUP NG error had changed to SYS ERR and it even states this on Sony&#039;s site yet it&#039;s still a brick. I bought this unit the day it
was released back in april 2009 so it&#039;s not a bad batch as mentioned above. From reading the above posts it does this on numerous player models regardless if done via the home network of the update disc. Sony&#039;s told me on the phone it was not a covered warranty item and so they would not pay for shipping and
i told them i was going to file a complaint with the BBB. It clear that their firmware update had caused this issue. They should next day me a new unit and have a prepaid return label on the box , this is the way Dell does it as they truly support their products.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi, to clear things up, i first tried the online update where the s360 got bricked, i then tried the disc option afterwards with no success.

After getting the runaround from sony repair centres (since these are mostly retail outlets, they dont want to know about online purchased warranty repairs), i phoned Amazon (where i purchased from) and they swapped with a new unit next day. Thumbs up to Amazon. Well done for a customer service that far exceeds that of a high street retailer.]]></description>
