  <p>Sean,</p>

  <p>I would make an appointment. Just as an aside, the email system should be used only if you can wait 24-48 hours for a response. It is not for more urgent needs.</p>

  <p>Hope that helps</p>

<p>Which is interesting, since I can’t actually find anywhere on the site that says <em>“Only use this if you can wait one or two days for a response.”</em> It says, <em>“Send nonurgent health questions to your doctor’s office.”</em></p>

<p>I’m unsatisfied with this. I want the interface to work. If the doctor is in, it should not say that he is out. And in the event that it reports things incorrectly, I would like the doctors to accept responsibility for their organization’s system and apologize for my inconvenience. And if I can’t expect what in my opinion is a modicum of service, then why am I paying so dearly for it? Shouldn’t this level of sloppy service be easily achieved by some socialist healthcare system?</p>
