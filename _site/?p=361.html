  <p>I came down with this Sunday of last week and it has not improved by any notable amount. Any new advice?</p>

  <p>P.S. I really don’t blame you for being confused. The patient-facing interface of [this web based messaging system] is a train-wreck of unintuitive design, so I expect the doctor-facing side must be at least as bad. You still appear to be “out of office.” Of course, maybe you really are out of office and you simply neglected to mention that in your last email.</p>
