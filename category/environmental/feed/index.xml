				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, my kids&#8217; doctor asked me how often we eat fast food and I said, &#8216;never.&#8217; Then later I wondered if Panda Express counted. I suppose it could, depending on what you order, so maybe I&#8217;ll mention it next time we&#8217;re at the doctor&#8217;s office. But we will continue to eat there from time to time, because it&#8217;s tasty and it seems healthy, for the most part.</p>
<p>I think we should all stop eating shrimp. The <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/029672_Shrimp_environment.html">damage we&#8217;ve done to our oceans in the name of a few prawn cocktails</a> is terrible, and <a href="http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/40963">shrimp farming is pretty bad</a>, too. And while <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?fid=44">good options for shrimp</a> exist, I seriously doubt anyone&#8217;s going to go to the trouble to find out where their shrimp louie came from.</p>
<p>That said, Panda Express works well for us because my wife and I have all but eliminated noodles, rice, bread, and potatoes from our diet. The kids still eat bread and all; it&#8217;s mainly our diets in which it&#8217;s been deprecated. And we can order a plate full of vegetables there, instead of rice or noodles, to go with our entr&eacute;es.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as we entered Panda Express we were greeted by about twenty employees, all of whom enthusiastically welcomed us in a fashion I haven&#8217;t experienced since visiting Tokyo, where the workers of every store or eatery will loudly welcome you as soon as you enter. Only this time we were in a Chinese restaurant in our hometown of Novato.</p>
<p>I was excited to have an opportunity to use the few words in Mandarin I know, 喜欢中国菜 (I like Chinese food). To which the man I was speaking to replied, &#8220;Me too!&#8221; Amusingly, that man was Andrew Cherng, the man who founded Panda Express. Affable and approachable, he was happy to take a photo with me. That&#8217;s him in the photo on the wall behind us, too, albeit a little younger.</p>

The lawn is long gone. I tried real hard, honest I did. But then the <a href="http://www.ppws.vt.edu/scott/weed_id/cynda.htm">bermuda grass</a> came, and that was that. But lawn&#8217;s are kind of ridiculous anyway; they suck up so much water. So, we&#8217;ve decided to put in a patio.</p>
<div id="attachment_402" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/stuff/front-yard-2015-bricks-2c.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-402" title="front-yard-2015-bricks-2d" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg" alt="The patio we hope to have for our front yard." width="624" height="468" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d.jpg 624w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/07/front-yard-2015-bricks-2d-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We hope it will look something like this.</p></div>
<p>We just endured our first quote from a paver salesman, and it was pretty awful. Pushy, aggressively ingratiating, and he could not stop talking about how great his company is and how he never loses a sale. And the price: hoo boy. We weren&#8217;t expecting this to be cheap, but wow those were some big numbers. I wish he could have just emailed them to us; enduring a second visit was a chore. As his mood changed from bubbly to maudlin (&#8220;I really thought I was going to make a sale today.&#8221; he said sadly), all I could think about was getting him out of our house.</p>
<p>We may go with stamped concrete, too. Although we haven&#8217;t gotten any quotes for that yet, we expect it to be cheaper.</p>

<p>One of the most unnerving aspects of global climate change for the human psyche to absorb is that it drives home with absolute finality the notion that Earth is finite. I know, that sounds obvious, but people have never behaved as if Earth were finite. They have behaved as if Earth and its resources, the environment itself, were infinite.</p>
<p>The Keeling Curve doesn’t demonstrate that climate is changing; it simply provides the evidence that supports the most obvious mechanism to account for the global warming that has also been measured. It does show, in two very concrete ways, that Earth’s atmosphere is finite and can be impacted by the biosphere. Humans account for the increase over time; plants account for the annual periodicity.</p></blockquote>
