After updating the firmware via the network connection, the Sony BDP-S360 died. It just flashes &#8220;SYS ERR&#8221; on the screen now and Sony&#8217;s eSupport says it will have to be sent in for repairs. In 7 to 10 days, not including shipping time, I may (or may not) get back a functional player. I sure hope Sony gets this Blu-ray thing sorted out soon. <http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?upd_id=4941&#038;mdl=BDPS360>
