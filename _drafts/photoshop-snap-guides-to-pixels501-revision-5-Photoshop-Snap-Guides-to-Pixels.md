Photoshop allows you to place a guide anywhere, which can be frustrating if you do Web work and you want to cut an image by hand, or even create slices that work.

But Photoshop will only select things by the pixel. So, the key to getting your guides right on the border between two pixels is to select first&#8230;

Then create your guide. Use the selection edge to snap your guide against.
