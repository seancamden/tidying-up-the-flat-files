A few steps toward building sites on the World Wide Web.

  1. [Learn HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [learn CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), too. HTML defines the nuts and bolts of everything on the Web. CSS is what you use to make it look nice. [CSS is pretty cool](http://www.cssbeauty.com/gallery/) and provides a [wide range of design options.](http://www.csszengarden.com/) But [it has limitations](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/are-you-making-these-10-css-mistakes/) that, unless you understand the working parameters, are not going to be intuitive to someone coming from a print background.
  
    Also, be concerned about good UI. [Steve Krug](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Common-Sense-Approach-Usability/dp/0789723107) and [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/) are two authors who have explored this field, and you might find the things they&#8217;ve written helpful.
  2. Do some blogging. Get a free blog from [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) or [Blogger.com](https://www.blogger.com/start) and post a few things. Post about the weather, post about the books you read. The subject matter is not important. This is just a way to get the feel of how things work on the Web.
  3. Buy a domain. Buy a few domains. Your domain is, sort of, the online equivalent to a store-front, and they can be fun, too. [Think up a cool name that no one else has thought](http://instantdomainsearch.com/) of and buy it at any of the online registrars like directnic or godaddy.
  4. Host your own site. You&#8217;ll need to use an FTP program of some sort. [Filezilla](http://fileZilla-project.org/) is a fine choice, but many, many more exist. You&#8217;ll also need to pay a web host and follow some instructions (instructions that will be easy to follow because you already learned HTML and CSS). This site is currently hosted at [Laughing Squid](http://laughingsquid.us/), but [many, many others](http://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting&#038;ie=utf-8&#038;oe=utf-8&#038;aq=t&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#038;client=firefox-a) can easily be found.
  5. Learn about [web analytics](http://www.getclicky.com/), [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), and [online advertising](http://www.Google.com/AdWords). Your clients will need this stuff because, unlike a brick and mortar store front, a &#8220;location&#8221; on the Web has to be generated.

While the w3schools.com lessons are great, to dive deeper without breaking the bank the [O&#8217;Reilly School of Technology](http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/htmlcss/) is a sensible option.
