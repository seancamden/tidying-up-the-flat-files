I just added these movies to my _Netflix Streaming Queue_. A few of them I&#8217;ve seen already but will enjoy watching again. 

Much has been said about [Netflix&#8217;s lousy selection of movies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/02/02/netflixs-lousy-selection-of-movies/), and I suppose it&#8217;s true. However, I think only the extremely myopic could fail to notice one thing: _Netflix_ is the only big player in the streaming movie business that isn&#8217;t gouging its customers.

I pay $8 a month for access to thousands of movies. Sure, they&#8217;re not all A-Listers, but that eight bucks I pay grants me 24-hour access to watch all or part of each of them whenever I want without restriction. That&#8217;s a good deal.

For comparison, I paid _Amazon Video on Demand_ over $35 just in the last two months to watch just a handfull of movies and have had to watch the movies I &#8220;paid for&#8221; within 48 hours. That&#8217;s a bad deal, and here&#8217;s why: 

Streaming a movie over a wire costs a lot less than producing and shipping a DVD or a Bluray. Managing the bits over a wire is probably less than one tenth as expensive, but it could be much lower. Bits over a wire changes the scenario in profound ways. 

The streaming method allows for no possible way for damage to be done to the movie. That means a great deal of the risk inherent in offering physical products for sale simply evaporates.

The cost of housing all those physical copies, the rent on the building, the cost of driving them around, the long chain of production facilities needed to produce and package the disk have all evaporated.

No longer does this business require the popularity of certain movies to be forecast, nor does this business ever have to account for the losses involved in purchasing too many or too few copies to match the unpredictable demand.

Because digital storage and delivery means no limits exist to the number of copies of a particular movie, and no limits to the number of people that can watch it even at the same time, when you watch a streaming movie you are not preventing someone else from watching that movie, the way you would be if you rent a physical disk.

The very concept of a timed rental, arose out of the need of a proprietor to get the movie back so it could be rented again. If any one client kept the physical copy too long it would directly jeopardize the sale&#8217;s profitability. When applied to a digital copy of a movie, this is no longer the case. In fact, it is pure make-believe. Amazon and others expect you will not realize that they are, essentially, charging you for a purely imaginary good. It would be obvious if it weren&#8217;t for the memory of the old, physical disk limitations still fresh in your mind.

and that you will continue to pay for a non-existent limitation. Simply because the way it has always been done works for their plans to generate even more profit doesn&#8217;t make it a good deal.

No one ever needs to worry about damage being done to the movie. 

Amazon expects most people to lack the capacity to recognize 

: don&#8217;t like the movie as much as you thought you would? Stop, choose another, no problem.

So maybe one or more of the movies I list below will help you set aside your burning desire to consume the latest that Hollywood has to offer.
