A few steps toward building sites on the World Wide Web.

  * 1. [Learn HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [learn CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), too. It&#8217;s not hard, really. HTML is orders of magnitude easier to grasp than, say, computer programming. And even if you plan to hire web monkeys to do this for you, you should know how the pieces fit together. Without this, you&#8217;re essentially a chef who knows only how to warm up pre-cooked meals.
  * 2. Do some blogging. Get a free blog from [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) or https://www.blogger.com/start and post a few things. Post about the weather, post about the books you read. The subject matter is not important. This is just a way to get the feel of how things work on the Web.
