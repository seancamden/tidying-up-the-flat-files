A few steps toward building sites on the World Wide Web.

  1. [Learn HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [learn CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), too. HTML defines the nuts and bolts of everything on the Web. CSS is what you use to make it look nice. [CSS is pretty cool](http://www.cssbeauty.com/gallery/) and provides a [wide range of design options.](http://www.csszengarden.com/) But [it has limitations](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/are-you-making-these-10-css-mistakes/) that, unless you understand the working parameters, are not going to be intuitive to someone coming from a print background. 
    Also, be concerned about good UI. [Steve Krug](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Common-Sense-Approach-Usability/dp/0789723107) and [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/) are two authors who have explored this field, and you might find the things they&#8217;ve written helpful.
    
    It&#8217;s not hard, really. HTML is orders of magnitude easier to grasp than, say, computer programming. And even if you plan to hire web monkeys to do this for you, you should know how the pieces fit together. Without this, you&#8217;re essentially a chef who only knows how to warm up pre-cooked meals.</li> 
    
      * Do some blogging. Get a free blog from [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) or [Blogger.com](https://www.blogger.com/start) and post a few things. Post about the weather, post about the books you read. The subject matter is not important. This is just a way to get the feel of how things work on the Web.
      * Buy a domain. Buy a few domains. Your domain is, sort of, the online equivalent to a store-front, and they can be fun, too. [Think up a cool name that no one else has thought](http://instantdomainsearch.com/) of and buy it at any of the online registrars like directnic or godaddy.
      * Host your own site. You&#8217;ll need to use an FTP program of some sort. [Filezilla](http://fileZilla-project.org/) is a fine choice, but many, many more exist. You&#8217;ll also need to pay a web host and follow some instructions (instructions that will be easy to follow because you already learned HTML and CSS). This site is currently hosted at [Laughing Squid](http://laughingsquid.us/), but [many, many others](http://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting&#038;ie=utf-8&#038;oe=utf-8&#038;aq=t&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#038;client=firefox-a) can easily be found.</ol> 
    
    While the w3schools.com lessons are great, to dive deeper without breaking the bank the [O&#8217;Reilly School of Technology](http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/htmlcss/) is a sensible option.
