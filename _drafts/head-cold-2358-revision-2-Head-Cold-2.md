> Almost all of these illness are viral. Most take 5 -7 days for improvement and resolve on their own. Viruses do not respond to antibiotic. A true bacteria sinus infection is a secondary infection and actually a fairly unusual complication of a viral upper respiratory illness. These come on after 7 &#8211; 10 days. They are usually characterized by a cold which doesn&#8217;t improve after 7 -10 days or one that improves and then becomes worse.

> Green or colored mucous is frequently seen in a viral illness, so we can&#8217;t differentiate viral from bacterial based on this.

> I would suggest over the counter cold remedies and salt water nasal rinses. These are comfort measures and don&#8217;t speed up the recovery process, but can relieve some of the symptoms. Please inform patient to follow-up if any new symptoms, things worsen or fail to improve in the next 4 -5 days.
