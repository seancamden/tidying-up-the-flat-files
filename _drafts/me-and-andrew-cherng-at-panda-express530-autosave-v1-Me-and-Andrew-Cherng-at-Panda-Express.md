Recently, my kids&#8217; doctor asked me how often we eat fast food and I said, &#8216;never.&#8217; Then later I wondered if Panda Express counted. I suppose it could, depending on what you order, so maybe I&#8217;ll mention it next time we&#8217;re at the doctor&#8217;s office. But we will continue to eat there from time to time, because it&#8217;s tasty and it seems healthy, for the most part.

I think we should all stop eating shrimp. The [damage we&#8217;ve done to our oceans in the name of a few prawn cocktails](http://www.naturalnews.com/029672_Shrimp_environment.html) is terrible, and [shrimp farming is pretty bad](http://www.enn.com/top_stories/article/40963), too. And while [good options for shrimp](http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?fid=44) exist, I seriously doubt anyone&#8217;s going to go to the trouble to find out where their shrimp louie came from.

That said, Panda Express works well for us because my wife and I have all but eliminated noodles, rice, bread, and potatoes from our diet. The kids still eat bread and all; it&#8217;s mainly our diets in which it&#8217;s been deprecated. And we can order a plate full of vegetables there, instead of rice or noodles, to go with our entr&eacute;es.

Yesterday, as we entered Panda Express we were greeted by about twenty employees, all of whom enthusiastically welcomed us in a fashion I haven&#8217;t experienced since visiting Tokyo, where the workers of every store or eatery will loudly welcome you as soon as you enter. Only this time we were in a Chinese restaurant in our hometown of Novato.

I was excited to have an opportunity to use the few words in Mandarin I know, 喜欢中国菜 (I like Chinese food). To which the man I was speaking to replied, &#8220;Me too!&#8221; Amusingly, that man was Andrew Cherng, the man who founded Panda Express. Affable and approachable, he was happy to take a photo with me. That&#8217;s him in the photo on the wall behind us, too, albeit a little younger.<figure id="attachment_531" style="width: 816px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
