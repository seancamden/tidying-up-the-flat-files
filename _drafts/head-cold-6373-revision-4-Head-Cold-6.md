And then I get this a few hours later.

Which is interesting, since I can&#8217;t actually find anywhere on the site that says that. It says, _&#8220;Send nonurgent health questions to your doctor&#8217;s office.&#8221;_ not, _&#8220;Only use this if you can wait one or two days for a response.&#8221;_

I&#8217;m unsatisfied with this. I want the interface to work. If the doctor is in, it should not say that he is out. And in the event that it reports things incorrectly, I would like the doctors to accept responsibility for their organization&#8217;s system and apologize for my inconvenience. And if I can&#8217;t expect what in my opinion is a modicum of service, then why am I paying so dearly for it? Shouldn&#8217;t we expect that this level of sloppy service could easily be achieved by socialist healthcare systems?
