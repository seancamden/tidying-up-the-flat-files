I just added these movies to my Netflix Streaming Queue. A few of them I&#8217;ve seen already but will enjoy watching again. 

Much has been said about [Netflix&#8217;s lousy selection of movies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/02/02/netflixs-lousy-selection-of-movies/), and I suppose it&#8217;s true. However, I think only the extremely myopic could fail to notice one thing: Netflix is the only big player in the streaming movie business that isn&#8217;t gouging its customers.

I pay $8 a month for access to thousands of movies. Sure, they&#8217;re not all A-Listers, but that eight bucks I pay grants me 24-hour access to watch all or part of each of them whenever I want without restriction. 

For a comparison, I paid Amazon Video on Demand over $35 just in the last two months and have had to watch the movies I &#8220;paid for&#8221; within 48 hours. To me, that seems like a bad deal, and here&#8217;s why: 

Streaming a movie over a wire costs a lot less than producing and shipping a DVD or a Bluray. Managing the bits over a wire is probably less than one tenth as expensive, but it could be much lower. Bits over a wire changes the scenario in profound ways: don&#8217;t like the movie as much as you thought you would? Stop, choose another, no 

So maybe one or more of the movies I list below will help you set aside your burning desire to consume the latest that Hollywood has to offer.
