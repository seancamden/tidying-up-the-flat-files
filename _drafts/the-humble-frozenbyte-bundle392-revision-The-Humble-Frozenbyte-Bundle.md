[The Humble Bundle returns](http://www.humblebundle.com/) with games from [Frozenbyte, an independent game development company](http://frozenbyte.com/).

I don&#8217;t actually have time to play games much these days, but I love supporting [DRM](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm)-free software. For my $50 In addition to the games themselves, which I can download from their servers as many times as I need, the soundtracks are also included as folders of MP3s. And the tracks, all written by [Ari Pulkkinen](http://www.aripulkkinen.com/), are quite good.
