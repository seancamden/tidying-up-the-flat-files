I just installed [Swype](http://www.swypeinc.com/) on my Android phone, and it works pretty well. [Fitaly](http://www.fitaly.com/) was my last favorite hand held input method, but the stylus has gone the way of the [8-Trak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-track_tape). This method is fast and intuitive; it does a good job of guessing what word you want based on your finger&#8217;s scribbling across the, slightly larger than the default Android, keyboard. It&#8217;s not perfect; sometimes your finger will be hiding the keys you want to slide over, forcing you to pause and misspell. But given how awful most hand held input methods are, it&#8217;s a fine improvement.

This warning screen is a bit unnerving, particularly considering this recent article at CNet [Report: A fifth of Android apps expose private data](http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20008518-245.html) (via Slashdot). So maybe I won&#8217;t use Swype to enter any passwords. But it&#8217;s less functional for entering passwords anyway.
