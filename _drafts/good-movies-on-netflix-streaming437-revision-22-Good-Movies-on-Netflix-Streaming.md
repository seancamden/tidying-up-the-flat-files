I just added these movies to my _Netflix Streaming Queue_. A few of them I&#8217;ve seen already but will enjoy watching again. 

Much has been said about [Netflix&#8217;s lousy selection of movies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/02/02/netflixs-lousy-selection-of-movies/), and I suppose it&#8217;s true. However, I think only the extremely myopic could fail to notice one thing: _Netflix_ is the only big player in the streaming movie business that isn&#8217;t gouging its customers.

I pay $8 a month for access to thousands of movies. Sure, they&#8217;re not all A-Listers, but that eight bucks I pay grants me 24-hour access to watch all or part of each of them whenever I want without restriction. That&#8217;s a good deal.

For comparison, I paid _Amazon Video on Demand_ over $35 just in the last two months to watch just a handfull of movies and have had to watch the ones I &#8220;paid for&#8221; within 48 hours. That&#8217;s a bad deal, and here&#8217;s why: 

Streaming a movie over a wire costs a lot less than producing and shipping a DVD or a Bluray. Managing the bits over a wire is probably less than one tenth as expensive, but it could be much lower. Even if you want to quibble with my math, which is obviously not the result of an exhaustive statistical analysis, you have to see that bits over a wire changes the scenario in profound ways. 

The streaming method allows for no possible way for damage to be done to the movie. That means a great deal of the risk inherent in managing physical products simply evaporates.

The cost of housing all those physical copies, the rent on the building, the cost of driving them around, the long chain of production facilities needed to produce and package the disk: all gone.

No longer does this business require the popularity of certain movies to be forecast, nor does this business ever have to account for the losses involved in purchasing too many or too few copies to match the unpredictable demand.

Because digital storage and delivery shifts the all distribution related limits into the elastic realm of virtual servers, whoever has the bandwidth to connect can watch the movie. Limits to the number of people that can watch, even the same movie at the same time, have effectively vanished.

The concept of a timed rental arose out of the need of a proprietor to get the movie back so it could be rented again. If any one client kept the physical copy too long it would directly jeopardize the transaction&#8217;s profitability. When applied to a digital copy of a movie, this is no longer the case. It makes no difference how long the purchaser takes to consume the product. Amazon and others expect you will not realize that they are, essentially, charging you for a purely imaginary good.

This would be obvious to you if it weren&#8217;t for the memory of the old, physical disk limitations still fresh in your mind. Without that, such a fee would make about as much sense as a business that charges you a &#8220;[convenience fee](http://www.thedailybizarre.com/?p=173)&#8221; for purchasing show tickets that no longer need to be printed or delivered. Oh yeah, we&#8217;re getting screwed all over the place.

So maybe one or more of the movies I list below will help you set aside your burning desire to consume the latest that Hollywood has to offer, while patronizing one of the few big companies not aggressively trying to screw you sideways.
