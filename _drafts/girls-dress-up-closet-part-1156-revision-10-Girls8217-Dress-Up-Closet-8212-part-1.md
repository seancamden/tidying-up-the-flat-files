First step was designing it in Sketchup. [Download the skp file](http://seancamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/girls-closet.zip).

Then I laid out the pieces to see how to cut them out of an 8&#8217;x4&#8242; sheet of 1/2&#8243; plywood.

And cut &#8217;em out.

Next it will be time to do some routing. I will use the circle cutting jig I just made to rout the curved tops of the closet sides.

After that I&#8217;ll shape most of the exposed edges with the router before I begin assembly.
