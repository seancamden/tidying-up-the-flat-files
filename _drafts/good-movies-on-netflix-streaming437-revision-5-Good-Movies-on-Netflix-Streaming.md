I just added these movies to my Netflix Streaming Queue. A few of them I&#8217;ve seen already but will enjoy watching again. 

Much has been said about [Netflix&#8217;s lousy selection of movies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/02/02/netflixs-lousy-selection-of-movies/), and I suppose it&#8217;s true. However, I think only the extremely myopic could fail to notice one thing: Netflix is the only big player in the streaming movie business that isn&#8217;t gouging its customers.

I pay $8 a month for access to thousands of movies. Sure, they&#8217;re not all A-Listers, but that eight bucks I pay grants me 24-hour access to watch all or part of each of them whenever I want without restriction. 

For a comparison, I paid Amazon Video on Demand over $35 just in the last two months and have had to watch the movies I &#8220;paid for&#8221; within 48 hours. To me, that seems like a bad deal, and here&#8217;s why: 

Streaming a movie over a wire costs a lot less than producing and shipping a DVD or a Bluray. Managing the bits over a wire is probably less than one tenth as expensive, but it could be much lower. Bits over a wire changes the scenario in profound ways. The streaming method allows for no possible way for damage to be done to the movie. That means all the risk inherent in offering physical products for sale simply evaporates. That means big savings for the proprietor. 

No limit exists to the number of copies of a particular movie when streamed digitally. Therefore, your watching a streaming movie is not preventing someone else from watching that copy, the way you would be if you rent a physical disk. Therefore, the concept of a timed rental, when applied to a digital copy of a movie, is pure make-believe. Amazon and others expect you will not realize that, and that you will continue to pay for a non-existent limitation. Simply because the way it has always been done works for their plans to generate even more profit doesn&#8217;t make it a good deal.

No one ever needs to worry about damage being done to the movie. 

Amazon expects most people to lack the capacity to recognize 

: don&#8217;t like the movie as much as you thought you would? Stop, choose another, no problem.

So maybe one or more of the movies I list below will help you set aside your burning desire to consume the latest that Hollywood has to offer.
